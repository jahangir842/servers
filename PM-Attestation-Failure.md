### ESXi Host TPM Attestation Failure in ESXi or vCentre

**Overview:**
TPM (Trusted Platform Module) attestation on an ESXi host is a security feature that ensures the integrity of the hardware and the hypervisor by leveraging the TPM hardware module. This attestation process provides a cryptographic proof that the ESXi host has not been tampered with. If attestation fails, it could indicate issues with the hardware, configuration, or certificates, potentially leaving the system vulnerable to security risks.

This guide provides an in-depth explanation of what TPM attestation is, common causes of failure, how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue, and what steps to take for preventive measures.

### 1. **What is TPM and TPM Attestation?**

**TPM (Trusted Platform Module):**
- TPM is a hardware-based security component embedded in a computer's motherboard or installed as an **add-on module**. It stores **cryptographic keys** and is used to enhance security for various tasks, including **securing boot processes** and storing encryption keys for **full-disk encryption**.
  
**TPM Attestation:**
- Attestation is a process that verifies the integrity of the ESXi host's boot process by comparing the current configuration and state with a reference state stored in the TPM chip. The goal is to ensure the ESXi host boots securely and has not been modified in an unauthorized manner.

### 2. **Common Causes of TPM Attestation Failure in ESXi Hosts**

If TPM attestation fails on an ESXi host, several common reasons could be the cause:

#### a) **Unsupported TPM Firmware/Hardware:**
   - The TPM chip may not meet the required version (TPM 2.0 is generally required for attestation).
   - Outdated or incompatible TPM firmware could result in attestation failure.

#### b) **Incorrect TPM or BIOS Settings:**
   - TPM may not be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI settings, or the mode could be incorrectly set (it needs to be set to **Active** or **Enabled**).
   - Secure Boot may not be configured properly in the BIOS.

#### c) **Incompatible Host Configuration:**
   - If the ESXi host's configuration (e.g., boot configuration, hardware state, or hypervisor version) has changed but is not reflected in the attestation server, attestation might fail.
   - Incorrect or corrupted certificates used for TPM attestation.

#### d) **TPM Ownership Issues:**
   - If TPM ownership has not been established correctly or was taken over by another system or software, attestation could fail.

#### e) **ESXi Configuration or Upgrade Issues:**
   - After upgrading ESXi, attestation may fail if the upgrade process altered critical system components in a way that conflicts with the attestation server’s records.
   - Mismatched versions of certificates or missing trusted key information.

#### f) **Communication Issues with vCenter**:
   - vCenter may be unable to communicate properly with the TPM on the host due to network issues or certificate-related problems.
   - vCenter’s Hardware Support Manager may be misconfigured.

### 3. **Troubleshooting TPM Attestation Failures**

#### a) **Check BIOS/UEFI Settings:**
   - Ensure that the TPM is enabled and functioning in the BIOS/UEFI settings.
   - Secure Boot should be enabled in the BIOS.
   - Ensure that the TPM is set to "Active" or "Enabled" and not in "Disabled" or "Deactivated" mode.
   
#### b) **Verify TPM Version and Firmware:**
   - Check that the TPM version is at least **TPM 2.0**, as TPM 1.2 is not supported for attestation in recent ESXi versions.
   - Update the TPM firmware to the latest version provided by the hardware vendor.

#### c) **Check ESXi Host Logs**:
   - Analyze the **VMkernel logs** on the ESXi host to identify errors related to TPM attestation. The logs can be checked for errors by running:
     ```
     cat /var/log/vmkernel.log | grep -i tpm
     ```
   - Look for error messages such as "TPM attestation failure" or related terms.

#### d) **Reset TPM Ownership:**
   - You may need to clear the TPM (reset it to factory settings) and then re-establish ownership:
     1. Power off the ESXi host.
     2. Access BIOS/UEFI and clear the TPM settings.
     3. Re-enable TPM and re-establish ownership after clearing.
   - This process allows vCenter or ESXi to take control of the TPM again and attempt attestation.

#### e) **Review Certificates and Key Trusts:**
   - Check that the TPM-related certificates are correct and up-to-date. If certificates have expired or are not recognized, attestation will fail.
   - Verify that the **Hardware Support Manager (HSM)** in vCenter has the correct certificates and that it can communicate with the TPM properly.

#### f) **Update ESXi Hosts and vCenter:**
   - Ensure that your **ESXi host** and **vCenter** are up-to-date with the latest patches, especially security patches related to TPM.
   - Mismatched versions between ESXi and vCenter can sometimes result in TPM attestation errors, particularly after an upgrade.

#### g) **Reconfigure TPM Attestation in vCenter:**
   - If vCenter is unable to attest the ESXi host, try disabling and re-enabling TPM attestation:
     1. In the vCenter UI, navigate to **Hosts and Clusters**.
     2. Select the ESXi host with the attestation failure.
     3. Disable the TPM attestation and then re-enable it after confirming settings.
   - This will force the system to re-attempt the attestation process.

### 4. **Preventive Measures to Avoid TPM Attestation Failures**

#### a) **Regular Firmware Updates:**
   - Ensure that the TPM firmware is kept up-to-date. Regularly check with your hardware vendor for firmware updates.
   
#### b) **Standardized BIOS/UEFI Configuration:**
   - Keep a standardized BIOS/UEFI configuration template for TPM, Secure Boot, and other security settings to ensure uniformity across ESXi hosts.

#### c) **Test and Validate After ESXi Upgrades:**
   - After upgrading ESXi, ensure that TPM attestation is functioning as expected by checking both the vCenter and ESXi host logs for attestation success or failure messages.
   
#### d) **Regular Certificate Management:**
   - Monitor and update any certificates used in TPM attestation. Make sure that these certificates are valid and trusted by the system.
   
#### e) **Ensure Compatibility with vCenter:**
   - Make sure that both vCenter and the ESXi hosts are running compatible versions to avoid attestation issues caused by version mismatch or outdated security features.

### 5. **Related Errors and Solutions**

#### a) **Host TPM Module Unavailable:**
   - This error could indicate that the TPM is disabled in BIOS/UEFI. Re-enable it through the system settings.
   
#### b) **TPM Device Not Found:**
   - Indicates that ESXi cannot detect the TPM device. Check physical connections and ensure that the TPM chip is seated properly on the motherboard.

#### c) **Secure Boot Failure:**
   - If Secure Boot is not enabled, attestation can fail. Enable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI and ensure that the boot components are properly signed.

### 6. **Useful Commands**

- **View TPM Status on ESXi**:
   ```
   esxcli hardware trustedboot get
   ```

- **Check TPM-related logs**:
   ```
   cat /var/log/vmkernel.log | grep -i tpm
   ```

- **View Hardware Support in vCenter**:
   - Navigate to vCenter → **Menu** → **Administration** → **Certificates** to check the status of the certificates and their expiration.

### Conclusion

TPM attestation failure on ESXi hosts can indicate issues with the hardware configuration, firmware, certificates, or ESXi/vCenter compatibility. Proper troubleshooting, including reviewing BIOS settings, TPM ownership, certificate management, and log analysis, is crucial to resolve attestation failures. Regular updates, consistent configurations, and best practices in managing TPM and security settings help prevent such failures in the future.
