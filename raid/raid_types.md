### RAID Types Explained 
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is used for performance, redundancy, or both. Here’s a quick breakdown:

| **RAID Level** | **How It Works** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Survives Disk Failures** | **Minimum Disks** |
|--------------|----------------|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **RAID 0** (Striping) | Splits data across multiple disks | ⚡ Fastest read/write | ❌ No redundancy (1 disk fails = all data lost) | ❌ 0 (No fault tolerance) | **2** |
| **RAID 1** (Mirroring) | Copies data to two disks | ✅ Full redundancy | ❌ Only half storage usable | ✅ 1 (Can lose 1 disk) | **2** |
| **RAID 5** (Striping + Parity) | Data + parity spread across **all disks** | ✅ Redundant, good performance | ❌ Slower writes | ✅ 1 (Can lose 1 disk) | **3** |
| **RAID 6** (Striping + Double Parity) | Like RAID 5, but **2 parity disks** | ✅ Survives 2 disk failures | ❌ Even slower writes | ✅ 2 (Can lose 2 disks) | **4** |
| **RAID 10** (RAID 1 + 0) | Mirrors & stripes (combines RAID 1 & 0) | ✅ Best speed + redundancy | ❌ High storage cost | ✅ 1 disk per RAID 1 pair (depends on setup) | **4** |

### **Best RAID Plan for Your Dell 750 Server with VMware ESXi**
1. **RAID 1 (2 SSDs - 1TB each) for ESXi** → High reliability for the hypervisor.  
2. **RAID 5 or RAID 10 (4 HDDs - 2.4TB each) for VM Storage** → Balances redundancy & performance.

A simple way to differentiate between **RAID 0** and **RAID 1**:  

### **RAID 0 (Zero Redundancy, Only Speed)**
- **"0" means ZERO redundancy** → No data protection  
- **Striping** → Data is split across multiple disks  
- **Faster performance** but **higher risk** (if one disk fails, all data is lost)  
- **Use case**: Speed-focused tasks (gaming, video editing)  

💡 **Mnemonic:** "RAID 0 = **0** protection"

### **RAID 1 (1-to-1 Copy for Safety)**
- **"1" means ONE exact copy** → Data is mirrored  
- **Mirroring** → Each disk has a full copy of the data  
- **Slower write speeds but high fault tolerance** (if one disk fails, data is safe)  
- **Use case**: Critical data storage (databases, servers)  

💡 **Mnemonic:** "RAID 1 = **1** copy for safety"  

🚀 **Quick Summary:**  
- **RAID 0 = Speed (No Protection)**  
- **RAID 1 = Safety (Mirroring)**
