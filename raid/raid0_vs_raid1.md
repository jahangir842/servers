A simple way to differentiate between **RAID 0** and **RAID 1**:  

### **RAID 0 (Zero Redundancy, Only Speed)**
- **"0" means ZERO redundancy** â†’ No data protection  
- **Striping** â†’ Data is split across multiple disks  
- **Faster performance** but **higher risk** (if one disk fails, all data is lost)  
- **Use case**: Speed-focused tasks (gaming, video editing)  

ðŸ’¡ **Mnemonic:** "RAID 0 = **0** protection"

### **RAID 1 (1-to-1 Copy for Safety)**
- **"1" means ONE exact copy** â†’ Data is mirrored  
- **Mirroring** â†’ Each disk has a full copy of the data  
- **Slower write speeds but high fault tolerance** (if one disk fails, data is safe)  
- **Use case**: Critical data storage (databases, servers)  

ðŸ’¡ **Mnemonic:** "RAID 1 = **1** copy for safety"  

ðŸš€ **Quick Summary:**  
- **RAID 0 = Speed (No Protection)**  
- **RAID 1 = Safety (Mirroring)**
