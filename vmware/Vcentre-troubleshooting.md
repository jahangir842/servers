### Vcentre Troubleshooting

1. To install vcentre make sure a add a `DNS entry` for static IP and it `hostname` in your `DNS Server`, because while installing the vcentre, it resolved it.

### Error: vcentre no healty upstream


### Solution

1. **Check DNS Configuration**: Ensure that the vCenter server is configured with the correct DNS server settings. You can verify this in the network settings.

2. **Hostname Resolution**: Test if the vCenter hostname can be resolved correctly from the server itself and from other servers (like ESXi hosts) using `nslookup` or `ping`.

3. **Reverse DNS**: Ensure that reverse DNS lookup is functioning properly for the vCenter server. This is important for some services to authenticate correctly.

4. **Hosts File**: As a temporary workaround, you can add the vCenter server's IP address and hostname to the `/etc/hosts` file (on Linux) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (on Windows) to bypass DNS resolution issues.

5. **Check DNS Records**: Verify that the appropriate A and PTR records exist in your DNS. 

6. **DNS Cache**: Clear the DNS cache on the vCenter server and any relevant client systems. This can often resolve stale entries that cause connectivity problems.

7. **Network Changes**: If there have been any recent network changes (e.g., moving to a new subnet), ensure that all DNS records are updated accordingly.

By addressing DNS issues, you may be able to resolve the connectivity problems affecting vCenter. If the issue continues, further investigation into logs and services may be necessary.
